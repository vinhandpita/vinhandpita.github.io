		<p id="story">Vinh and Pita first met in a small boba shop named "Pink Boba." 
			It was there that they got to know each other a bit better before they
			went to go see Toy Story 4 at AMC Dine-In theater. From then on,
			the attraction was love at first bite when Pita shared some of her
			dinner with Vinh. The two planned on meeting up again and decided to run 
			a 5K together on the 4th of July. Before that, Vinh took Pita hiking
			on the Black Walnut trail of Rowland Heights, CA. Because of the hiking
			training, the two ran the 5K at an endurable pace and had tons of fun.
			Later that night, Vinh asked Pita to be his girlfriend during the
			fireworks and now they are to be married.
